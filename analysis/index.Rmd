On this website we present some initial analysis of the ROMS-ETHZ model output submitted to RECCAP2-ocean.

This initial analysis covers results from 4 model runs (A-D).

The diagnostic plots differ for following types of variables:

-   T: Regionally integrated time series data
-   XYT: 2D-fields of variables with monthly resolution
-   XYZT: 3D-fields of variables with annual resolution
-   ancillary data

Please navigate trough the navbar on top to take a look at the various chapters of this analysis. The links in the upper right corner bring you to the source code of this project and back to Jens' main homepage.
